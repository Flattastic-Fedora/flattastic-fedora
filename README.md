flattastic-fedora
=================

Flattastic-Fedora is a fork of the Flattastic theme by nale12 (http://nale12.deviantart.com/art/Flattastic-11-03-2014-424913255)

It is inspired by the classic Bluecurve theme from Redhat Linux and the early Fedora Core,
and provides an alternative to Gnome's Adwaita theme, which is installed on Fedora by default.


Problems
--------
(Mostly shared with Flattastic)

- The left and right buttons for tabs in epiphany have a double-width 
bottom border, as the arrow buttons are not tabs and thus don't overlap.

- The omnibar in Epiphany is off-center vertically because of the top border.

- The menu overlay lacks some shaddow to make it distiguishable.
