flattastic-fedora
=================

Flattastic-Fedora is a fork of the Flattastic theme by nale12 (http://nale12.deviantart.com/art/Flattastic-11-03-2014-424913255)

It is inspired by the classic Bluecurve theme from Redhat Linux and the early Fedora Core,
and provides an alternative to Gnome's Adwaita theme, which is installed on Fedora by default.
